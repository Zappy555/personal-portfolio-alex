ReadMe on My Personal Portfolio Webpage
The project had the following objective

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB/.
Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.
User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

Things I learnt building my personal portfolio webpage

Using Bootstrap in combination with html, I discovered it was relatively easier laying out my site structure 
* I used and got very familiar with the bootstrap grid system on four major screen sizes {extra-small(xs), small(sm), medium(md) and large(lg)} and their break points
* I Understood the fixed top and floating navbar
* I created collapsible navbar with data-toggle and navbar-collapse bootstrap classes and used the icon-bar class in a <span></span> element to create the nav icon bars on smaller screens
* Used the jumbotron class for creating section spanning the entire with of the container with grey background
* Played a lot with <button> class and types for my social media follow buttons
* I used bootstrap classes to create each of my portfolio boxes and used the filter class and some jQuery to filter
* I played with progress bar for the level of my skill set with percentages display
* I built the contact section creating forms and using form-group classes, label for, input type and text area 
* Rounding up, I built my copyright area relatively easier and linked to my freecodecamp profile. 
* Finally, I used the data-spy class in the "body" element of the html to make the nav links take you to each section of the site parsing the navbar ID to the data-target class.

I published it on my codepen.io account, announced it on twitter and shared on frontend helpers of freecodecamp forum and voila! project two was concluded.
